This is a simple project that uses tailwind/php/twig
this has to keep the most minimalistic tech stack possible.
the index.php should render the one and only page (twig template)
in the future the index.php will just include a php file array that will be the data for the page (no database, no api, no external data)
keep doing the most basic things to answers requests.

never install dependencies (or ask for it)
